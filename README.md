WayFindr – An intent-centric travel dApp proposal built on Anoma
# WayFindr – An Intent-Centric Travel dApp

## 🌍 Overview
WayFindr is a cultural dApp built on Anoma...
WayFindr reimagines travel through Anoma’s intent architecture.
Instead of step-by-step bookings, users simply declare their intent:

“I want to journey from Paris to Avalon, under 500 gold.”

Anoma’s solvers then weave the path — airships, inns, ferries — until the desire is fulfilled. The traveler doesn’t chase tickets; the path is conjured.
🚀 Why WayFindr?

No friction: Declare your destination and limits, let Anoma do the orchestration.

Beyond borders: Works across chains, currencies, even layers of myth and reality.

Adaptive coordination: Matches budgets, constraints, and preferences automatically.

Mystical UX: Travel becomes less about transactions, more about intent shaping destiny.
🔗 Example Scenarios

London → Valhalla, under 2000 silver
Solver assembles a ferry, a longship, and a lodge on the fjord.

Rome → ElminsterHaven, with maximum comfort
Solver arranges airship passage, a silk-lined inn, and safe passage through the forests.

New York → Atlantis, eco-friendly route only
Solver maps ocean ferry + submersible, minimizing footprint.


Each path is different, but the traveler simply speaks their wish — the system handles the rest.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Declare Intent: Travelers state start, end, budget/constraints.


2. Anoma Matcher: Solver cycles through routes, currencies, and providers.


3. Orchestration: Multi-party intents settle into one seamless journey.


4. Completion: Traveler confirms, journey recorded on-chain.

## 📈 Vision
WayFindr isn’t just a booking tool.
It’s a mythic travel oracle that shows how Anoma turns intent into lived reality.

A bridge between the ordinary and the extraordinary.

A living showcase of intent-centric design.

A new way to imagine coordination: not through lists and clicks, but through wishes spoken into being.
