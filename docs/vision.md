# WayFindr – Extended Vision

WayFindr is more than a travel dApp.  
It’s a **new way of thinking about movement, intent, and coordination**.

## 🌍 The Problem
Travel today is fragmented:  
- Too many apps and intermediaries.  
- Users must manually plan flights, hotels, and transport.  
- Cross-border coordination is slow, expensive, and frustrating.  

## ✨ The Solution
With WayFindr, users don’t plan step by step.  
They declare their **intent**:

- “I want to go from England to Valhalla on X budget.”  
- “I want the fastest route from Paris to Kyoto.”  

Anoma’s **intent-centric matcher** coordinates across:  
- Airlines ✈️  
- Hotels 🏨  
- Local services 🚖  
- Even community-led travel groups.  

All solved automatically — no juggling tabs, no fragmented payments.

## 🌌 Why It Matters
- **Simplifies travel** into pure intent.  
- **Unlocks new markets**: decentralized travel planning.  
- **Showcases Anoma’s power** beyond DeFi — coordination as the new economy.

WayFindr is not just a travel tool.  
It’s a proof-of-concept for **how intent can reshape real-world systems**.
